# Heap
Heap is a memory location that a program can use at runtime. The heap is less organized than the [[Stack]]. When you allocate data on the stack you ask for a certain amount of space and the memory allocator finds an empty spot on the heap that is big enough, marks is as being in use, then returns a [[Pointer]] for the address of the location.
