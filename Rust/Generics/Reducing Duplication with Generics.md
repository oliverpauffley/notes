# Reducing Duplication with Generics
By placing a generic in the function signature we can allow a much more flexible api.

If we wanted to find the largest [[Integers| int]]  or [[Char]] we could do so with two functions
```rust
fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest_i32(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);
    assert_eq!(result, &100);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest_char(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
    assert_eq!(result, &'y');
}
```

Clearly the logic in both `largest` functions is the same. So to make this function generic we place type name declarations inside angle brackets like so:
```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
```
The rest of the function is unchanged
```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```
> note that this won't compile as our function is defined for any type but some cannot be ordered. We need to use the `PartialOrd` [[Traits|trait]].
