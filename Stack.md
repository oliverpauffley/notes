The stack is part of the memory system a program can access at runtime. The stack stores values in order is gets them and removes them in the opposite order. Normally called *last in, first out*. Like a stack of plates, you pile on more plates when you add them and always take a plate from the top of the stack. 

- All data on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown size is stored on the [[Heap]].
